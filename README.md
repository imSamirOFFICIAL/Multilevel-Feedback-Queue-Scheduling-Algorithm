# Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling Algorithm

This is a Java code that implements the Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling Algorithm. The code prompts the user for the following inputs: The number of Queues, The Quantum Time for each Queue, The Aging Time, The Number of Processes, and for each process its: ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority. Then, the code simulates the Scheduling Algorithm. Finally, at the end of the simulation, it generates a report that includes the following: The Sequence of Execution (Gantt Chart), The Average Turnaround Time, and The Average Waiting Time. Additionally, for each process, the report includes its: Arrival Time, Burst Time, Response Time, Waiting Time, and Turnaround Time.

# How to run this code?

I wrote this code in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and ran it successfully. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that this code will run correctly in any other IDE. However, before running this code in Visual Studio Code, you must ensure that your operating system has the latest version of the [JDK Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads) installed.

Now, open the `MultilevelFeedbackQueueSchedulingAlgorithm.java` file in `Visual Studio Code` and click on the `Run` button located in the upper right corner.
