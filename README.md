# Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling Algorithm

This is a Java code that implements the Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling Algorithm. The code prompts the user for the following inputs: The number of Queues, The Quantum Time for each Queue, The Aging Time, The Number of Processes, and for each process its: ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority. Then, the code simulates the Scheduling Algorithm. Finally, at the end of the simulation, it generates a report that includes the following: The Sequence of Execution (Gantt Chart), The Average Turnaround Time, and The Average Waiting Time. Additionally, for each process, the report includes its: Arrival Time, Burst Time, Response Time, Waiting Time, and Turnaround Time.
